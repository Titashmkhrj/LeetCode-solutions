# LeetCode attempts and slutions.
This repository is going to consist all my leetcode attempts and the solutions.
I will be using the python programming language to begin (I know it's not the best choice for this),
but I might use something else along the journey if I feel like it.
The reason I am using python is I intend on getting better in this language.
The goal of this repo is to practice as much as I can and get better at solutioning and problem solving. 
Hope you find this useful in anyway.
happy coding.
